# Code Refactor 

## Description 

Refactored the code to meet best practice standards. Updates can include but are not limited to ensuring links are functioning as expected, the div tags are standardized amongst sections of the page, spacing and CSS elements are uniform, and the code is dry and easily digestible. 

Disclaimer: this code was not written by me, just refactored.
